# ISS-overhead-notifier
A simple API that notifies via e-mail the user once the ISS is in his exact cordinates, the API will read the user longitute and latitude and check if the ISS is passing past his location and a bot will send a email asking the user to look up to see the object moving through the space. The project was done with Python and the request library.
